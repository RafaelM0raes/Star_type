## Desciption

This is a dataset consisting of several features of stars.

Some of them are:

Absolute Temperature (in K)

Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)

Relative Radius (R/Ro)

Absolute Magnitude (Mv)

Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)

Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)

Star Type **(Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)**

Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)

Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)

## Data Collection and Preparation techniques:
The dataset is created based on several equations in astrophysics. They are given below:

Stefan-Boltzmann's law of Black body radiation (To find the luminosity of a star)

Wienn's Displacement law (for finding surface temperature of a star using wavelength)

Absolute magnitude relation

Radius of a star using parallax .

The dataset took 3 weeks to collect for 240 stars which are mostly collected from web.

The missing data were manually calculated using those equations of astrophysics given above.
